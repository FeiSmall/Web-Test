&emsp; Today,I want learn something about python and git
- python
1.  any()
&emsp;&emsp;The any() function is used to determine if the given iterable parameter iterable is False , then returns False,and if one is True,it returns True.
2.  zip()
&emsp;&emsp; The zip() function takes an iterable object as a parameter,packs the corresponding elements in the object into a tuple, and returns a list of these tuples.
if the number of the elements in each iterator is inconsistent, the returns list length is the same as the shortest object, and the * operator can be used to extract the tuple into the list.
